# Task
The Nautilus DevOps team has some confidential data present on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. There is a container ```ubuntu_latest``` running on the same server. We received a request to copy some of the data from the docker host to the container. Below are more details about the task:

On ```App Server``` 1 in Stratos Datacenter copy an encrypted file ```/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg``` from docker host to ```ubuntu_latest``` container (running on same server) in ```/usr/src/``` location. Please do not try to modify this file in any way.

## Solution 
Connect to the App Server 1.

```sh
ssh tony@stapp01
```

Copy the encrypted file /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg to ubuntu_latest container.

```sh
sudo docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/usr/src/
```

Check if the file was copied successfully.
```sh
docker exec ubuntu_latest  ls -ltr /usr/src
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 105 Sep 19 19:46 nautilus.txt.gpg
```
